                    <p>Welcome! My name is Mona Lea and my desire is to support and equip woman with the gospel through facilitating and
                    speaking events.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was raised in the military by a family, escaping an impoverished lifestyle, and not following Jesus. I met Jesus
                at 11, however my life began to look like the world around me later on. At 22, there was an incident that
                changed my life forever, and drew me back to Jesus, and I often speak about it. I then began the adventure of discipleship for over 30 years. I
                married the best man ever 32 years ago, and now with 3 perfectly imperfect children who are now adults! For 5 years I
                have been speaking at events, leading the church’s Woman’s ministry, and have been the Director of
                Discipleship Ministries.</p>

                        <p>Based on Mark 12:30-31, we will take the teaching of Jesus and explore what it looks like for the everyday woman to have a love affair with God that is <q>an ecstatic sort of relationship that makes the most rapturous relationship between a man and a women seem like milk and water.</q> CS Lewis</p>
