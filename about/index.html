                        together along with skiing in
                        the winter and traveling when possible. We continue to tell people that marriage gets better
                        with time and effort!</p>

                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>Having served in Woman’s ministries in the past, I am living my best life as the Director of
                        Discipleship Ministries at
                        Cross Point Church where we have attended for the past 22 years!</p>
                    <p>I enjoy panting and having coffee and deep conversation with friends. At the end of the day, my passion is reading,
                        studying and sharing God’s
                        Word while teaching how to apply it to one’s life with inspiring stories, much laughter
                        and occasional tears. I have found pure joy through following the call to teach, speak and lead.</p>
