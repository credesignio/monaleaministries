                    <p>I am married to a lovely man named Gary for 32 years! Gary and I enjoy riding our bikes together along with skiing in
                    the winter and traveling when possible. We continue to tell people that marriage gets better with time and effort!</p>

                    <p>Christian is now a 26-year-old young man who is sensitive, caring, athletic and intelligent.  He graduated from
                    Whitworth University and is working at Schweitzer Engineering with 3D printers.</p>
                    <p>Zach is one of the funniest people you would ever meet with a sensitive, beautiful heart. He is majoring in Film and
                    Theater at the University of Idaho.</p>
                    <p>Maddie is our athletic, disciplined daughter who has graduated from the University of Idaho with a Medical Science
                    degree and is now applying to Medical Schools.</p>

                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>Having served in Woman’s ministries in the past, I am living my best life as the Director of Discipleship Ministries at
                    the church I have attended for the past 22 years!</p>
                    <p>I also have recently taken up painting! But at the end of the day, my passion is reading, studying and sharing God’s
                    Word and how to apply it to one’s life with inspiring stories, real-life examples, much laughter and occasionally some
                    tears.  Teaching, speaking, leading and evangelism bring life to my bones.</p>
